Work in progress (for next version):
- Add popup hint to show Gantt chart load values.
- Limit iCal calendar entries to actually allocated time slots.
- Check FreeBSD repository patches
  (http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/deskutils/taskjuggler/files/)
- Add 'extend' support for accounts.

Probably:
- Macros to do date/time arithmetic.
- 'limits' for tasks, not just for allocations.
- vacations for tasks (to suspend a part of a project for some time).
- Interactive account report
- 'completedeffort' and 'pendingeffort' column
- add a search box or filter field (like in the sidebar for file task
  and others) in UI Report, to be able to find easily tasks (by task
  id) or task resources
- Legend to explain meaning of HTML report Gantt elements.

Maybe:
- Make vacations and shifts scenario specific.
- Timezone support for resources and shifts.
- Limits for accounts.
- support for renewable resources
- Allocation selection by skill set.
- Add support for flexible rates (per task, per shift)
- Cleanup taskjuggler library API, so it can be used by other apps.
- Color support for tasks and resources.
- Gap with snap on weekdays.
- Macros like ${TODAY}, ${ProjectStart}, ...
